# Screw Geometry
I've been thinking of a game that screws with you just as much as it does with Euclidean
geometry. Basically a world where the smallest distance between two points is not necessarily
a straight line. </br>

This is more of a playground than anyhting else. Hopefully this gives me some ideas about 
the puzzles I can do in the game.
